# Data Visualization with D3
*This project is a json file creator from csv file.*

## Arc Diagram
Just implement the simplest way, according to the csv file format
for now, in csv file column:
* No.1 means Arc Diagram Type
* No. 2 & No. 3 mean Arc Diagram ID
* No. 4 means Arc Diagram Type
* No. 5 & No. 6 mean Arc Diagram ID
* No. 7 & No. 8 are useless in this implementation

## TODO
1. Add config file format csv file
2. Add more diagram support
